Ping Pong Game
Ping Pong is a classic two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from reaching their side of the screen. The objective is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

Game Controls
Player 1 (Left Paddle):

Move Up: Press the "W" key
Move Down: Press the "S" key
Player 2 (Right Paddle):

Move Up: Press the Up arrow key

Game Rules
The game starts with the ball in the center of the screen, and the players' paddles positioned on each side.
Players can move their paddles up and down to hit the ball.
The ball moves continuously, bouncing off the paddles and the top and bottom borders of the screen.
If the ball reaches the left or right border, the respective player on that side scores a point, and the ball is reset to the center.
The game continues until a player reaches the winning score (determined by you) or until the game is manually stopped.
The score is displayed at the top of the screen, showing the number of points for each player.
Code Structure
The code is written in Python and uses the Turtle module for graphics.
The game window is initialized, and the necessary components, including the paddles, ball, and score display, are created.
Event listeners are set up to capture keyboard inputs and move the paddles accordingly.
The main game loop continuously updates the screen, moves the ball, checks for collisions, and updates the score accordingly.
Customization
You can customize the game by modifying various parameters such as the window size, paddle speed, ball speed, colors, and fonts.
Additionally, you can add more features to the game, such as sound effects, levels, or power-ups, based on your preferences and programming skills.
